# CVc-for-General-Models
Codes for Chapter 4 of my Ph.D. dissertation , titled "Cross validation for correlated data in general models for regression and classification, with applications to Deep Learning" 


Access to CelebA dataset (available at https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) is required in order to generate Figure 6.

The datasets for Figure 7 are included indise the folder 'DNN model on AirBNB data'. 


To genrate Figure 6 - initially run the code file 'Smile Detection' and store the results. Then, run the code file 'Plot Figure 6' while directing the data-importing call to the right path. One may run the code file 'Smile Detection' repeatedly with 'SampSize1' equal to 20 in each run (to avoide too long runtime) and aggregate the resulted data.  


To genrate Figure 7 - initially run the code file 'Hot-water Detection' and store the results. Then, run the code file 'Plot Figure 7' while directing the data-importing call to the right path. One may run the code file 'Hot-water Detection' repeatedly with 'SampSize1' equal to 40 in each run (to avoide too long runtime) and aggregate the resulted data.
